Twitter being one of the initial online social media platforms to allow bots to autonomously perform operations like tweeting, re-tweeting, liking, following and much more. An estimate of two-third of the tweeted links in popular websites are posted by these bots. In order to ensure the information shared across the platform through conversations is credible, there is a need to focus on identification of spam bots. This will be an effort to prevent malicious automation from disrupting userâ€™s experience on twitter. Motivated by the need to identify and filter out the spam bots we have come up with an approach to distinguish between genuine accounts and spam twitter bots. 

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is available at https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/bot-repository/contribute.html. I used cresci -2017 data which consist of 3,474 genuine accounts, 4,912 social spambots and 1,100 traditional spambots details such as number of followers, following count, listed count, created date. There are 2,839,362 tweets by humans and 3,457,344 tweets by bots.
